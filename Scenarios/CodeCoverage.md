# Collect Code Coverage

> **Preview:** This feature is work-in-progress and is not guaranteed to work in all scenarios and setups yet. If you encounter issues, disable the setting and report the problem.

AL-Go for GitHub supports collecting code coverage data during test runs. When enabled, the pipeline uses the AL Test Runner to execute tests and collect line-level coverage information, which is output as a Cobertura XML file in the build artifacts.

## Enabling Code Coverage

Add the following to your `.AL-Go/settings.json` or `.github/AL-Go-Settings.json`:

```json
{
    "enableCodeCoverage": true
}
```

Read more about settings at [Settings](settings.md#enableCodeCoverage).

## How It Works

When `enableCodeCoverage` is set to `true`:

1. AL-Go replaces the standard test runner (`Run-TestsInBcContainer` from BcContainerHelper) with a built-in override that uses the **AL Test Runner** (`Run-AlTests`).
2. The AL Test Runner connects to the Business Central container via client services and executes tests while tracking which lines of AL code are executed.
3. After tests complete, the raw coverage data (`.dat` files) is processed into **Cobertura XML** format — a widely supported standard for code coverage reporting.
4. The Cobertura XML file is saved to the `CodeCoverage` folder in the build artifacts.

## Output

The coverage output is available in the build artifacts under the `CodeCoverage` folder:

- **`cobertura.xml`** — Coverage data in Cobertura XML format, suitable for integration with coverage visualization tools.
- **`.dat` files** — Raw coverage data from the AL Test Runner.

## Limitations

- **Custom `RunTestsInBcContainer` overrides:** If your repository has a custom `RunTestsInBcContainer.ps1` override in the `.AL-Go` folder, it will take precedence over the built-in code coverage override. A warning will be emitted in the build log. To collect code coverage with a custom override, your script must use `Run-AlTests` (imported automatically by AL-Go) with the appropriate code coverage parameters.
- **Work-in-progress:** The AL Test Runner is a new component and may not support all test configurations that the standard BcContainerHelper test runner supports. If you experience test failures or missing test results after enabling code coverage, disable the setting and report the issue.

## Using Code Coverage with a Custom Override

If you need a custom `RunTestsInBcContainer.ps1` override and also want code coverage, your script can call `Run-AlTests` directly. The module is imported automatically by AL-Go at pipeline startup. Key parameters for code coverage:

```powershell
Run-AlTests @{
    ServiceUrl               = $serviceUrl
    Credential               = $credential
    CodeCoverageTrackingType  = 'PerRun'
    ProduceCodeCoverageMap    = 'PerCodeunit'
    CodeCoverageOutputPath    = $codeCoverageOutputPath
    # ... other test parameters
}
```

See the [AL-Go Settings](settings.md) documentation for the full list of available pipeline override scripts.
